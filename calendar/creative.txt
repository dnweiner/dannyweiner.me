For the creative portion, we did added a number of features, varying in size, including:

-when adding an event, changing the date field highlights the appropriate square on the grid, assuming you're viewing the month in question
-when adding an event, you can specify it to occur for 1-4 weeks (exclusively within the current month) - these events display as crimson
-check the box in each event to flag it (shows up as lightgreen - or darkgreen, if weekly)
-logout button and add event form do not appear until a user is logged in
-refresh button is generated in the first empty cell of the grid, wherever that may be
-user can jump to any month in the current year by clicking on it in the dropdown, and any CE year by entering one in the neighboring field
-autofocus on username field
-currently logged-in username displays at top
-can add/modify event descriptions, which displays via a mouseover text on the event within the calendar

TA Login instructions:
If you want to login as a user that already exists on either instance, login with username "test1" and password "test1".
If you want to login as your own user, create your own username by entering a name and password and clicking register.
