      <h1>"Why don't you tell us a bit about yourself?"</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Danny Weiner; I recently graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a BS in Computer Science and significant coursework in Mathematics, Linguistics, and Political Science. Before all that, I hail from Buffalo Grove, Illinois, one of the many suburbs of Chicago. As a born-and-raised Midwesterner, not only do I appreciate good corn and deep dish pizza, but I also ascribe wholeheartedly to the idea of "Midwestern friendliness". At home and at school, there is a pervasive and welcoming atmosphere of support, congeniality, and community, and I would be hard-pressed to spend time in a less collaborative, well-meaning environment. I'm quick to tell you that I'm an extroverted introvert, because I love spending quality time with the meaningful people in my life, but I also thrive in my independent comfort zone as well. That, in nutshell, covers the two most prevalent, important, often distinct aspects of my everyday life: my role as a resident advisor (RA) and my passion for computer science. I guess you could say everything I do boils down to two things: programming... and programming. For my friends and residents, the former looks like hanging out, planning events, and keeping life light and fun (maybe checking some things off my bucket list, too). For my peers and colleagues, the latter looks like long hours spent brainstorming outside-the-box solutions, debugging, and endless test-driven development. Either way, the critical piece, for me, has always been making a difference and contributing to those around me: there is no work more worth doing. At this stage in my life, I am seeking to relocate to a new city and begin the next chapter of my life. To borrow a bit of Pixar parlance: <i>"Adventure is out there!"</i></p>
