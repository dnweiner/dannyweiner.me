        <h2 class="header">Accountability</h2>
        <p>Student Union should serve you, not themselves. I have always believed that if you set a standard, you must meet that standard, and Student Union doesn't always live up to the principles it presumes to propogate. As much as I respect SU and have developed close bonds with many that compose it, I have listened to too many friends and colleagues express concern to accept the current state of affairs. I, myself, have witnessed behaviors and decisions that do not respect the positions of power elected officials hold, and actively disrespect the student body. </p>

        <h2 class="header">Advocacy</h2>
        <p>Student Union should not be afraid to stand up for what's right. As your Vice President of Administration, the chief internal affairs officer of Student Union, I would be well-poised to work with Campus Life, the CDI, the DAC, the RSVP Center, and other campus partners to continue the Itâ€™s On Us campaign in earnest, aim more resolutions and projects to address the multivalent concerns of the many affinity spaces on this campus, and ensure that Student Union do more than Allocate and Program.</p>

        <h2 class="header">Inclusivity</h2>
        <p>The organization that represents the student body should strive to genuinely represent it, in every possible way. I will steer the Recruitment + Retention Committee to investigate why students of certain identities are more or less inclined to run, as well as how we can better encourage and support candidates of these underrepresented identities.</p>

        <h2 class="header">Community</h2>
        <p>Student Union is a sprawling body, and this can lead to indifference or frustration between entities; building a stronger sense of community may not be crucial, but it is still important to see a friendly working environment. My preferred style of leadership is bottom-up, not top-down, and that means developing an atmosphere of supporting one another, with a close-knit, firmly foundational Exec there to assist, guide, and set a productive agenda.</p>

      <div class="row container">
        <h2 class="header">Support</h2>
        <p>This is the kind of work I thrive in; it puts me in a position to do good by enabling others to do more than I can, whilst simultaneously providing the innate gratification proffered by supporting your friends as they achieve their dreams. Much of time, in official roles and as a friend, is this sort of faciliatory and administrative work, and I firmly believe the greatest legacy one can leave is one of assisting others in developing their own legacies.</p>
